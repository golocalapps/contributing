GIT WORKFLOW

What follows is a tutorial on standards and workflows for contributing to
GoLocalApps projects.  This is NOT a tutorial on how to use git and the commands
giving here should not always be copied verbatim.  You should learn what each
command is doing and what its context is here.

FORKING THE PROJECT

First, read the following articles on forking and syncing.

    * Fork A Repo <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/>
    * Syncing a fork <https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/>

Now create a fork of the project you will be working on.  As an example, let's
fork this one <https://github.com/golocalapps/contributing>.  Once forked, your
copy of the repository should live at:

    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/contributing

Once it's forked, clone your fork to your local machine.

    git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/contributing.git
    git remote add upstream git@github.com:golocalapps/contributing.git

The above commands only need to be issued once, and when you do so your fork
should already be in sync, but make sure you sync often.  Ideally, you should
sync every time you begin working with your repo.

SYNCING YOUR FORK

    git fetch upstream
    git checkout master
    git merge upstream/master
    git push origin master

CREATING A TOPIC BRANCH

Now that you're in sync you're ready to begin working.  Let's start by adding
your name to the AUTHORS file.  We're going to create a new topic branch, make
our changes, then push our topic branch to Github and issue a pull request for
code review.

    git checkout master     # make sure our new topic branch derives from master
    git branch add-author   # create our new topic branch
    git checkout add-author # switch to our new topic branch

Open the AUTHORS file in your favorite text editor and add your name and email
address.  Once you're finished, stage, commit and push your changes.

    git add AUTHORS
    git commit -m 'Add my name and email address to AUTHORS file.'

SUBMITTING A PULL REQUEST

When your branch is ready to be submitted for review, run the following:

    git push origin add-author

You can then see your branches at:

    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/contributing/branches

To the right of the branch named "add-author" you should see a button titled
"New pull request."  Click that and fill out the form to submit your pull
request to the maintainers who will review and (most likely) merge your branch.
